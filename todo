* managing sharing: readout groups, drp nodes, cnf files, timing system connections
 - Chris Ford is working on a shared-DAQ resource allocation manager
 - Matt Weaver has this big-optical-switch ("BOS") which is principle allows more flexible use of the shared DAQ nodes
 - right now we have rix/tmo "official" setups.  we should probably create another one for acr, and then another one for one-off setups (like what Bill Schlotter is doing tomorrow).
