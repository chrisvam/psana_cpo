* xtcav, vm_max_mapcount err, opal exposure, psocake, calibman, cross subnet pva/ca, sxrxtcav B940, seaberg opal, more ami/shmem cores, xtcdata throws
* new-style psana1:

 PHASE1:
 - (switch default to new-style: change /reg/g/psdm/etc/psconda.sh to new-style)
   o py2 by default
   o py3 if users choose (add -py3 option to psconda.sh)
 - understand new mpi? (e.g. IB segfaults) but cheetah suggests maybe OK
 - do at same time that we move to new nfs ("/cds")
 - keep the old style available if users desperately need it (old /reg/g/psdm/etc/psconda.sh becomes /reg/g/psdm/etc/psconda_old.sh)
 - calibman working (dark runs most important)
 - advertise reduced features to users: no psana modules, no old-style translator, no mpi-h5 mpi-pytables
 - move old-style/new-style to /cds
 - jenkins release (and nightly?) into new conda area
 - need mpi h5 for silke

 PHASE2:
 - (freezing old-style psana1-py2, and merging branches)
 - merge py3->master and tag
 - merge anarel-manage (removing py3 hacks)
 - make a new branch master->old_style_master (could work off this)
 - judgment call: how much to increase test coverage?  testing is currently minimal.

* timetool: sometimes 1020, sometimes 1024 bytes (matt)
** test power outages (ric, onsite)
* fiber power readings everywhere (matt, tid)
* peaknet
* ami features: projection along curve, angular integration, epics import + looping, travis, xarray reading, mpi offline/evt-jumping, subgraphs, gui regression (run graphs), web xface, combine coarse+fine(timetool) timing, edge case: graph surgery global operation (worker/collector1and2) disconnect/reconnect, mask generation, josh requests, hsd time axis, hover to get docstrings, performance monitoring (prometheus)?, reopen displays on graph load, default size larger, default symbol, scatter plot number of points too large, hide "configure" menu running online, make "apply" more obvious/easy, reset kills ami (likely psana), plot vs readable time, hover over plot to get point (1D, 2D)
  - josh: free-form scan (no steps)
  - alex: set scan bin size limits (is histogram ok?)
  - josh: nanosecond xpcs: 2 pulse acqiris.  ratio of peak areas, correlation
    export results to ACR
  - josh: xpcs photon counting, working with chuck: accumulate statistics
    and then fit, number of photons per shot in histogram (talk to chuck
    and silke sxrm23). nicholas burdet (shared postdoc)
  - alex: manta camera (allied vision):  project, fit a peak (gaussian),
    plot vs. other variable,  ideally integrate over events, but
    difficult for ami. 30Hz.  run in mode with only a single shot per image.
* timetool (ben): tag to front end, fiber power, toggle xpmini->lcls2 timing, clear readout
* simpler interface for controlling teb/meb?
* xtcav daq recording epics variables as well (and also bld values?) (matt)
** xtcav/psocake py3 compatible
