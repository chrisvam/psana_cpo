* prometheus python (eventually daq2 prometheus gui)
* create more platforms for procmgr
* daq2 chunking
* manta camera for rix
* why don't we get a c++ exception when we receive a configdb timeout?
* jupyter for lcls2 and new-style psana1
* unified/integrated timetool calibration
* move psana1 to mysql8
* fix failing new-style psana1 tests
* shifter mounting permissions (mona, johannes)

* test daq sequences (caf)
* active-det improvements (caf)
* psana1 MTRX:V2 geometry (mikhail)
* update procServ (caf)
* scan the configdb (caf)
* slow updates need to obey deadtime (matt)
* put the hsd p4p servers in base.cnf (make them long-lived)
* setting msgdelay in timing system? (matt)
* right now procmgr sets PATH to conda_rel.  could it "conda activate"?
* xpm deadtime showed up for all hsd's even though only one was dead (matt)
* syslog print throttling
* get the daq .cnf to do "conda activate"
* error on inconsistency between conda release used to build and .cnf (caf)
* move to use official conda rogue/epics (matt)
* use GIT_DESCRIBE_TAG in recipes
* kerberos tickets at nersc
* off-by-one (psana1/2)
* units support in det xface
* put psana2 (and psana1?) on conda-forge
* remote visualization/control
* calibdb dns issue (in travis macos build)
* psana hutch/exp specific algs (mona, silke, dan, seshu)
* in psana SRV callback only persist some fields to h5?
* improve cydgram (caf?)
* once we have real data, work more on timetool calc in firmware
* dlopen for reduction alg
* test calibman/geo (mikhail)
* nersc calib-dir sync (wilko)
* psana1: test py3 branches with py2 release
* run daq from release (matt)
* configdb history
* algorithms (drp/ana, e.g. beam-center finding)
* psana startup slope, smd0 performance with small batch size, end-job poor behavior (mona)
* psana live-mode test (mona, matt, ric)
* psana mem leaks (mona)
* singularity at slac (mona)
* support more python versions
** python DRP? (matt)
* monitoring for psana (mona, johannes)
* slurm and correcting problems with lsf
* psana monitoring system (like vmon)
* andor
** io performance (20GB/s)
* det-specific config editors?
* 1MHz operation
* fix conda base env
** consistent data format for opal/fakecam/xtcav.  Maybe not timetool since it's 1D.
* timetool: sometimes 1020, sometimes 1024 bytes (matt)
* reentrant rdma issue (ric)
* timetool
  - toeplitz
  - adding IIR epics stream
  - test multiple epics segments
** canary: rack 11: 10G switch, IB, Rack 12: 2 IB switches (no 10G) 2 dell nodes (onsite)
** test power outages (ric, onsite)
* fiber power readings everywhere (matt, tid)
* last mile cabling (transceivers, quad transceivers, fibers, quad-fibers, trigger cables, power cables)
* peaknet
* ami: timetool correction example, projection along curve, run on cmd line without json?, angular integration, slow box dragging, per-hutch/expt algs, epics import, CI, xarray reading, mpi offline, subgraphs, gui regression, web xface, hsd peaks, combine coarse+fine(timetool) timing
  - josh: free-form scan (no steps)
  - alex: set scan bin size limits (is histogram ok?)
  - josh: nanosecond xpcs: 2 pulse acqiris.  ratio of peak areas, correlation
    export results to ACR
  - josh: xpcs photon counting, working with chuck: accumulate statistics
    and then fit, number of photons per shot in histogram (talk to chuck
    and silke sxrm23)
  - alex: manta camera (allied vision):  project, fit a peak (gaussian),
    plot vs. other variable,  ideally integrate over events, but
    difficult for ami. 30Hz.  run in mode with only a single shot per image.
* timetool (ben): tag to front end, fiber power, toggle xpmini->lcls2 timing, clear readout
* simpler interface for controlling teb/meb?
* xtcav daq recording epics variables as well (and also bld values?) (matt)
