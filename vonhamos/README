two files to modify: user-adjustable parameters are at the top

**********************************************************************

You won’t be able to edit the files in my directory to edit the
parameters.  If you copy all the files to your own directory I believe
it should all just work, EXCEPT you have to edit this line in
mpi_driver.sh:

cd /reg/neh/home/cpo/ipsana/xcs/

Change the “cd” to your own directory.
